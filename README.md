Welcome! This project allows you to run a small friendly companion (Niko from OneShot!) on ur taskbar on the right.
Here's some info you gotta know before using:
- Background music is included in the app

- Left mouse click allows you to change his pose between standing and sitting
- Right mouse click allows you to make him say a sentence
- Mouse wheel click allows u to (un)pause the music

- To close the app, because there is no process bar, just click on him and press Alt+F4 or open the task manager, look for "Niko.exe" and kill the process
